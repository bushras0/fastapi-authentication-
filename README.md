Here's a sample `README.md` file for your FastAPI and MongoDB-based scenario where you have admin and employee roles, login and signup, document uploads, and role-based access control:

# FastAPI Document Management System

## Overview

This project is a **Document Management System** built with **FastAPI** and **MongoDB**, implementing a role-based access control mechanism for admin and employee roles. Admins can manage employee data and upload files that are visible to employees. Employees can view documents but are restricted from uploading them or accessing admin data. The application also features JWT-based authentication.

## Features

- **User Roles**: Two user roles: Admin and Employee.
  - **Admin**: Can register, log in, view all documents, upload documents, and manage employee data.
  - **Employee**: Can register, log in, and view only documents uploaded by the admin.
- **Document Upload**: Admins can upload documents (PDFs or other files) that are stored in MongoDB.
- **Role-based Access**: Admins can access employee data and upload documents. Employees are restricted from uploading files and accessing admin-specific data.
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for secure access control.

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: Backend framework
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing user and document data
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization
- **JWT**: Authentication using JSON Web Tokens
- **pdfplumber**: PDF text extraction (for PDF files uploaded by admins)
- **OAuth2**: For secure password hashing and user login
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server

## Project Structure

├── auth.py                    # Authentication functions (JWT, user verification)
├── database.py                # MongoDB connection and collections
├── models.py                  # Pydantic models for Users and Documents

```

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fastapi-doc-management.git
cd fastapi-doc-management
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up MongoDB

- Set up a MongoDB instance either locally or on **MongoDB Atlas**.
- Update your MongoDB connection string in `database.py`:

```python
client = MongoClient("your-mongodb-connection-string")
db = client["your-database-name"]
```

### 4. Run the Application

Use Uvicorn to run the FastAPI application:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

The app will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 5. API Documentation

FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation at:

- Swagger UI: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
- Redoc: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc)

## API Endpoints

### Authentication

- **POST** `/register`: Register a new user (admin or employee).
- **POST** `/login`: User login (generates JWT tokens).

### Documents

- **POST** `/document`: (Admin only) Upload a document with file and content.
- **GET** `/documents`: (Admin & Employee) Retrieve documents. Admins see all documents; employees see only those uploaded by admins.

## Environment Variables

To avoid hardcoding sensitive information, set the following environment variables in a `.env` file or your system:

```bash
MONGODB_URI="your-mongodb-connection-string"
SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key"
ALGORITHM="HS256"
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
```

## Role-Based Access Control

- **Admin**: Full access to all documents and the ability to upload new files.
- **Employee**: Can only view documents uploaded by admins. No upload permissions.

## Future Improvements

- Add file size limits and validation for file types.
- Implement pagination for document retrieval.
- Add email verification for user registration.
- Enhance security with OAuth2 scopes.
